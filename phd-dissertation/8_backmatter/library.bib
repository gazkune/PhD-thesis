abstract = {We present a real-time algorithm which can recover the 3D trajectory of a monocular camera, moving rapidly through a previously unknown scene. Our system, which we dub MonoSLAM, is the first successful application of the SLAM methodology from mobile robotics to the "pure vision" domain of a single uncontrolled camera, achieving real time but drift-free performance inaccessible to Structure from Motion approaches. The core of the approach is the online creation of a sparse but persistent map of natural landmarks within a probabilistic framework. Our key novel contributions include an active approach to mapping and measurement, the use of a general motion model for smooth camera movement, and solutions for monocular feature initialization and feature orientation estimation. Together, these add up to an extremely efficient and robust algorithm which runs at 30 Hz with standard PC and camera hardware. This work extends the range of robotic systems in which SLAM can be usefully applied, but also opens up new areas. We present applications of MonoSLAM to real-time 3D localization and mapping for a high-performance full-size humanoid robot and live augmented reality with a hand-held camera.},

abstract = {Intelligent Environments are expected to act proactively, anticipating the user’s needs and preferences. To do that, the environment must somehow obtain knowl- edge of those need and preferences, but unlike current computing systems, in Intelligent Environments the user ideally should be released from the burden of providing infor- mation or programming any device as much as possible. Therefore, automated learning of a user’s most common behaviors becomes an important step towards allowing an environment to provide highly personalized services. In this paper we present a system that takes information collected by sensors as a starting point, and then discovers frequent relationships between actions carried out by the user. The algorithm developed to discover such patterns is supported by a language to represent those patterns and a system of interaction which provides the user the option to fine tune their preferences in a natural way, just by speaking to the system.},
annote = {        Summary:        
        
The problem presented in this paper is different from ours. It is about discovering patterns in the day-by-day actions of users. Those patterns are obtained using their temporal relationships. There are a couple of interesting things for us, such as pattern definition and the so called Association Mining Process, which we could look up, but in general, it is quite far from our ideas.},

abstract = {The primary goal of the research reported in this paper is to identify what crite- ria are responsible for the good performance of a heuristic rule evaluation function in a greedy top-down covering algorithm. We first argue that search heuristics for inductive rule learning algorithms typically trade off consistency and cover- age, and we investigate this trade-off by determining optimal parameter settings for five different parametrized heuristics. In order to avoid biasing our study by known functional families, we also investigate the potential of using metalearning for obtaining alternative rule learning heuristics. The key results of this experi- mental study are not only practical default values for commonly used heuristics and a broad comparative evaluation of known and novel rule learning heuristics, but we also gain theoretical insights into factors that are responsible for a good performance. For example, we observe that consistency should be weighted more heavily than coverage, presumably because a lack of coverage can later be cor- rected by learning additional rules.},

abstract = {Computer vision research has been traditionally focused on the development of quantitative techniques to calculate the properties and relations of the entities appearing in a video sequence. Most object track- ing methods are based on statistical methods, which often result inadequate to process complex scenar- ios. Recently, new techniques based on the exploitation of contextual information have been proposed to overcome the problems that these classical approaches do not solve. The present paper is a contribution in this direction: we propose a Computer Vision framework aimed at the construction of a symbolic model of the scene by integrating tracking data and contextual information. The scene model, repre- sented with formal ontologies, supports the execution of reasoning procedures in order to: (i) obtain a high-level interpretation of the scenario; (ii) provide feedback to the low-level tracking procedure to improve its accuracy and performance. The paper describes the layered architecture of the framework and the structure of the knowledge model, which have been designed in compliance with the JDL model for Information Fusion. We also explain how deductive and abductive reasoning is performed within the model to accomplish scene interpretation and tracking improvement. To show the advantages of our approach, we develop an example of the use of the framework in a video-surveillance application.},
annote = {Summary:
        
This paper proposes an ontology-based activity recognition for vision-based systems. They use it mainly for tracking activities in complex scenarios. They design a set of ontologies, from low-level track informatio to activities and events. However, the main reasoning processes are achieved using rules, defined in the RACER reasoner. It is interesting to see the difference of deductive rules and abductive rules, which can add new knowledge in form of new instances to the ontology. Besides, they also integrate spatial reasoning, and consider temporal facts.
        
As future work, they identify incorporing uncertain information and reasoning in the framework.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose GP-COACH, a Genetic Programming-based method for the learn- ing of COmpact and ACcurate fuzzy rule-based classification systems for High-dimensional problems. GP-COACH learns disjunctive normal form rules (generated by means of a con- text-free grammar) coded as one rule per tree. The population constitutes the rule base, so it is a genetic cooperative-competitive learning approach. GP-COACH uses a token compe- tition mechanism to maintain the diversity of the population and this obliges the rules to compete and cooperate among themselves and allows the obtaining of a compact set of fuzzy rules. The results obtained have been validated by the use of non-parametric statis- tical tests, showing a good performance in terms of accuracy and interpretability.},

abstract = {Activity modelling is required to support activity recognition and further to provide activity assistance for users in smart homes. Current research in knowledge-driven activity modelling has mainly focused on single activities with little attention being paid to the modelling of composite activities such as interleaved and concurrent activities. This paper presents a hybrid approach to composite activity modelling by combining ontological and temporal knowledge modelling formalisms. Ontological modelling constructors, i.e. concepts and properties for describing composite activities, have been developed and temporal modelling operators have been introduced. As such, the resulting approach is able to model both static and dynamic characteristics of activities. Several composite activity models have been created based on the proposed approach. In addition, a set of inference rules has been provided for use in composite activity recognition. A concurrent meal preparation scenario is used to illustrate both the proposed approach and associated reasoning mechanisms for composite activity recognition.},

abstract = {Research on sensor-based activity recognition has recently made significant progress and is attracting growing attention in a number of disciplines and application domains. However, there is a lack of high-level overview on this topic that can inform related communities of the research state of the art. In this paper we present a comprehensive survey to examine the development and current status of various aspects of sensor-based activity recognition. We first discuss the general rationale and distinctions of vision-based and sensor-based activity recognition. Then we review the major approaches and methods associated with sensor-based activity monitoring, modeling and recognition from which strengths and weaknesses of those approaches are highlighted. We make a primary distinction in this paper between data-driven and knowledge-driven approaches, and use this distinction to structure our survey. We also discuss some promising directions for future research.},
annote = {        Summary: 
        
This paper makes an extensive survey of sensor-based activity recognition approaches. First of all, it separates vision-based activity recognition from other enviroment-integrated sensor-based activity recognition approaches. The survey is mostly dedicated to the last group. 
        
It is very interesting the taxonomy of the problem it depicts, showing data-driven and knowledge-driven approaches. Specially interesting is the table 1, where all the approaches are listed with their pro and cons.
        
The paper contains very interesting references that should be further analysed. Besides, it points out several future lines for activity recognition, where data uncertainty is present.

abstract = {Approaches and algorithms for activity recognition have recently made substantial progress due to advancements in pervasive and mobile computing, smart environments and ambient assisted living. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to achieve real-time continuous activity recognition as sensor data segmentation remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to real-time sensor data segmentation for continuous activity recognition. Central to the approach is a dynamic segmentation model, based on the notion of varied time windows, which can shrink and expand the segmentation window size by using temporal information of sensor data and activities as well as the state of activity recognition. The paper first analyzes the characteristics of activities of daily living from which the segmentation model that is applicable to a wide range of activity recognition scenarios is motivated and developed. It then describes the working mechanism and relevant algorithms of the model in the context of knowledge-driven activity recognition based on ontologies. The presented approach has been implemented in a prototype system and evaluated in a number of experiments. Results have shown average recognition accuracy above 83\% in all experiments for real time activity recognition, which proves the approach and the underlying model.},

abstract = {This paper describes the findings arising from ongoing qualitative usability evaluation studies on mobile companion robotics in smart home environments from two research projects focused on socio-technical innovation to support independent living (CompanionAble and Mobiserv). Key findings are described, and it is stated that the robotic companion, the smart home environment, and external services need to be seamlessly integrated to create a truly supportive and trusted system. The idea of robot personas is introduced, and based on our empirical observations, it is argued that the robot persona, rather than the physical embodiment, is the most important determinant of the degree of users’ acceptance in terms of users’ perceived trustability and responsiveness of the robot and therefore their sense of enhanced usability and satisfaction with such personal assistive systems.},

abstract = {While feature point recognition is a key component of modern approaches to object detection, existing approaches require computationally expensive patch preprocessing to handle perspective distortion. In this paper, we show that formulating the problem in a naive Bayesian classification framework makes such preprocessing unnecessary and produces an algorithm that is simple, efficient, and robust. Furthermore, it scales well as the number of classes grows. To recognize the patches surrounding keypoints, our classifier uses hundreds of simple binary features and models class posterior probabilities. We make the problem computationally tractable by assuming independence between arbitrary sets of features. Even though this is not strictly true, we demonstrate that our classifier nevertheless performs remarkably well on image data sets containing very significant perspective changes.},

In this paper, we present an in-depth study of activity modeling and reasoning within that framework, aswell as an experimental evaluation with a large real-world dataset.Our solution allows us to copewith the un- certain nature of ontological descriptions of activities, while exploiting the expressive power and inference tools of the OWL 2 language.

abstract = {Support vector machines (SVMs) are currently state-of-the-art for the classification task and, generally speaking, exhibit good predictive performance due to their ability to model nonlinearities. However, their strength is also their main weakness, as the generated nonlinear models are typically regarded as incomprehensible black-box models. In this paper, we propose a new Active Learning-Based Approach (ALBA) to extract comprehensible rules from opaque SVM models. Through rule extraction, some insight is provided into the logics of the SVM model. ALBA extracts rules from the trained SVM model by explicitly making use of key concepts of the SVM: the support vectors, and the observation that these are typically close to the decision boundary. Active learning implies the focus on apparent problem areas, which for rule induction techniques are the regions close to the SVM decision boundary where most of the noise is found. By generating extra data close to these support vectors that are provided with a class label by the trained SVM model, rule induction techniques are better able to discover suitable discrimination rules. This performance increase, both in terms of predictive accuracy as comprehensibility, is confirmed in our experiments where we apply ALBA on several publicly available data sets.},

abstract = {We study the problem of how to recognize a new human ac- tivity when we have never seen any training example of that activity before. Recognizing human activities is an essen- tial element for user-centric and context-aware applications. Previous studies showed promising results using various ma- chine learning algorithms. However, most existing methods can only recognize the activities that were previously seen in the training data. A previously unseen activity class can- not be recognized if there were no training samples in the dataset. Even if all of the activities can be enumerated in advance, labeled samples are often time consuming and ex- pensive to get, as they require huge effort from human an- notators or experts. In this paper, we present NuActiv, an activity recogni- tion system that can recognize a human activity even when there are no training data for that activity class. Firstly, we designed a new representation of activities using semantic attributes, where each attribute is a human readable term that describes a basic element or an inherent characteristic of an activity. Secondly, based on this representation, a two- layer zero-shot learning algorithm is developed for activity recognition. Finally, to reinforce recognition accuracy using minimal user feedback, we developed an active learning al- gorithm for activity recognition. Our approach is evaluated on two datasets, including a 10-exercise-activity dataset we collected, and a public dataset of 34 daily life activities. Ex- perimental results show that using semantic attribute-based learning, NuActiv can generalize knowledge to recognize un- seen new activities. Our approach achieved up to 79\% ac- curacy in unseen activity recognition.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the adoption of ontologies and ontological reasoning to automatically recognize complex context data such as human activities. In particular, the Web Ontology Language (OWL) emerged as the language of choice, being a standard for the Semantic Web, and supported by a number of tools for knowledge engineering and reasoning. However, the limitations of OWL 1 in terms of expressiveness have been recognized in various fields, and important research efforts have been made to extend the language while preserving decidability of its OWL 1 DL fragment. The result of such work isOWL2. In this paperweinvestigate the use ofOWL2 for modeling complex activities and reasoning with them.Weshow that the new language constructors of OWL 2 overcome the main limitations of OWL 1 for the representation of activities; OWL 2 axioms can be used to represent certain rules and rule-based reasoning previously demanded to hybrid approaches, with the advantage of having a unique semantics, avoiding potential inconsistencies. Then, we propose a system architecture showing the integration of a novel OWL 2 activity ontology and reasoning modules with distributed modules for sensor data aggregation and reasoning. The feasibility of our solution is shown by an extensive experimental evaluation with simulations of different intelligent environments.},

This paper makes an extensive feature description of OWL2 and shows how it can be used for complex activity recognition. It argues that OWL2 solves many of the problems found in OWL1, which were encouraging the adoption of hybrid techniques (OWL+rules). They argue that OWL2 allows avoiding rule-based extensions, which are problematic because they make the whole reasoning set undecidible. To show this, they provide a comparison among common hybrid approaches and OWL2. 
        
They show a possible solution for activity recognition based on ontologic reasoning, providing some experiments. Finally, they point out that data uncertainty cannot be taken into account natively in OWL2. They propose this as future work and point out some early solutions.},

abstract = {The quantum internet is predicted to be the next-generation information processing platform, promising secure communication and an exponential speed-up in distributed computation. The distribution of single qubits over large distances via quantum teleportation is a key ingredient for realizing such a global platform. By using quantum teleportation, unknown quantum states can be transferred over arbitrary distances to a party whose location is unknown. Since the first experimental demonstrations of quantum teleportation of independent external qubits, an internal qubit and squeezed states, researchers have progressively extended the communication distance. Usually this occurs without active feed-forward of the classical Bell-state measurement result, which is an essential ingredient in future applications such as communication between quantum computers. The benchmark for a global quantum internet is quantum teleportation of independent qubits over a free-space link whose attenuation corresponds to the path between a satellite and a ground station. Here we report such an experiment, using active feed-forward in real time. The experiment uses two free-space optical links, quantum and classical, over 143 kilometres between the two Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife. To achieve this, we combine advanced techniques involving a frequency-uncorrelated polarization-entangled photon pair source, ultra-low-noise single-photon detectors and entanglement-assisted clock synchronization. The average teleported state fidelity is well beyond the classical limit of two-thirds. Furthermore, we confirm the quality of the quantum teleportation procedure without feed-forward by complete quantum process tomography. Our experiment verifies the maturity and applicability of such technologies in real-world scenarios, in particular for future satellite-based quantum teleportation.},

When modeling reality we must take into account its ambiguous nature. Considering the uncertainty and vagueness in context data information it is possible to attain a more precise picture of the environment, thus leading to a more accurate inference process. To achieve these goals we present an ontology that models the ambiguity in intelligent environments and a data fusion and inference process that takes advantage of that extra information to provide better results. Our system can assess the certainty of the captured measurements, discarding the unreliable ones and combining the rest into a unified vision of the current user context. It also models the vagueness of the system, combining it with the uncertainty to obtain a richer inference process.},

@article{Chen2012a,
abstract = {This paper introduces a knowledge-driven approach to real-time, continuous activity recognition based on multi- sensor data streams in smart homes. The approach goes beyond the traditional data-centric methods for activity recognition in three ways. Firstly, it makes extensive use of domain knowledge in the lifecycle of activity recognition. Secondly, it uses ontologies for explicit context and activity modeling and representation. Thirdly and finally, it exploits semantic reasoning and classification for activity inferencing, thus enabling both coarse-grained and fine-grained activity recognition. In this paper we analyse the characteristics of smart homes and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) upon which we built both context and ADL ontologies. We present a generic system architecture for the proposed knowledge-driven approach and describe the underlying ontology-based recognition process. Special emphasis is placed on semantic subsumption reasoning algorithms for activity recognition. The proposed approach has been implemented in a function-rich software system, which was deployed in a smart home research laboratory. We evaluated the proposed approach and the developed system through extensive experiments involving a number of various ADL use scenarios. An average activity recognition rate of 94.44\% was achieved and the average recognition run-time per recognition operation was measured as 2.5 seconds},
annote = {        Summary:        
        
The paper presents a knowledge-driven activity recognition system, based on ontologic modeling and reasoning. 
        
Their scenario is based on sensor-based recognition, i.e. they use simple contact, pressure... sensors to monitor the location of the user and the interaction with objects. They model the context, the sensors and the activities, as a set of objects used for an activity. Besides, they provide two types of activity recognition: coarse activity (makeDrink) and fine-grained activity (makeTea). Furthermore, they have a generic description of activities and their personalization through user profiles.
        
To recognise activities, they use sensor activations and aggregations. The algorithm is well explained in section 5.2. Basically, via sensor aggregation they describe the current activity. Then, they check whether the activity description matches any activity description in the ontology. For that purpose, they use the reasoning capabilities of OWL (mainly subsumption).
        
With this solution they provide real-time incremental activity recognition. They can detect an activity (coarse) and improve the recognition when new sensor data arrives. To handle time, they admit no specific way is offered by OWL. But, by means of the incremental recognition approach, they define two methods to handle time, specially the sliding time window. 
        
They do not provide any specific way to handle sensor uncertainty, which is only modeled as faulty readings. As future work, they identify: large-scale experimentation of a diversity of activity scenarios, multi-user concurrent activity recognition and handling of temporal information such as sequence and duration.},

abstract = {A majority of the approaches to activity recog- nition in sensor environments are either based on manually constructed rules for recognizing activities or lack the ability to incorporate complex temporal dependencies. Furthermore, in many cases, the rather unrealistic assumption is made that the subject carries out only one activity at a time. In this paper, we describe the use of Markov logic as a declar- ative framework for recognizing interleaved and concurrent activities incorporating both input from pervasive light-weight sensor technology and common-sense background knowledge. In particular, we assess its ability to learn statistical-temporal models from training data and to combine these models with background knowledge to improve the overall recognition accu- racy. To this end, we propose two Markov logic formulations for inferring the foreground activity as well as each activities’ start and end times. We evaluate the approach on an established dataset. where it outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for activity recognition.},

The nature of these machines and the communication protocols they use is multifarious. Therefore, the applications running on top of them remarkably demand interoperability. The Triple Space Computing (\{TSC)\} paradigm addresses that problem by sharing information represented in a semantic format through a common virtual space. As long as application developers use standard ontologies, different applications using the same spaces will interact automatically. The focus of this paper is to present Otsopack, a fully distributed \{TSC\} middleware designed to meet the needs of mobile and resource constrained devices. Otsopack defines a simple \{HTTP\} interface for the \{TSC\} operations. This interface focuses on simplicity and modularity, so that two implementations that support different modules can still interact. To assess the middleware we provide time and load measurements, and we analyze two 
independent implementations.},

Relational learning techniques such as Inductive Logic Program- ming (ILP) hold promise for building such models, but have not been successfully applied to the very large datasets which result from video data. In this paper we present a novel supervised learning frame- work to learn event models from large video datasets(∼ 2.5 million frames) using ILP. Efficiency is achieved via the learning from inter- pretations setting and using a typing system. This allows learning to take place in a reasonable time frame with reduced false positives. The experimental results on video data from an airport apron where events such as Loading, Unloading, Jet-Bridge Parking etc are learned suggests that the techniques are suitable to real world scenarios. 1},

Recognizing the activities an elderly person who lives alone performs, and identifying potential problems from the detected activities is a very active topic of research. How- ever, current approaches do not take into account the fact that the way an activity is performed by a per- son evolves over time and therefore activities are identified by mapping them to a static model. In this work we describe and evaluate an approach for online classifying based on Evolving Fuzzy Systems (EFS): activities are described by a model that evolves over time, according to the changes observed in the way an activity is performed. These classifiers have been evaluated on three datasets obtained from real home settings, achieving a good recognition performance, at a confidence interval of 95\%, compared with well know probabilistic models in terms of F-Measure, but improving their performance in terms of online capabilities and ability to adapt to the evolving ways in which activities are carried out.},
annote = {        Summary:        
        
Authors tackle the problem of evolving activity recognition. They claim that people do not execute activities always in the same way, so the activity classification model should evolve accordingly. For that purpose, they use Evolving Fuzzy Systems, which evolve during time and can be used online.
        
However, the scenario they describe is quite simple. Activities are known and pre-defined (no new activity recognition), they use binay sensors and they get labels for the data. All in all, this paper is not very interesting for our approach. },

abstract = {The potential of type-2 fuzzy sets to manage high lev- els of uncertainty in the subjective knowledge of experts or of nu- merical information has focused on control and pattern classifica- tion systems in recent years.One of themain challenges in designing a type-2 fuzzy logic system (FLS) is howto estimate the parameters of the type-2 fuzzy membership function (T2MF) and the footprint of uncertainty (FOU) from imperfect and noisy datasets. This pa- per presents an automatic approach to learn and tune Gaussian interval type-2 membership functions (IT2MFs) with application to multidimensional pattern classification problems. T2MFs and their FOUs are tuned according to the uncertainties in the training dataset by a combination of genetic algorithm (GA) and cross- validation techniques. In our GA-based approach, the structure of the chromosome has fewer genes than other GA methods, and chromosome initialization ismore precise. The proposed approach addresses the application of the interval type-2 fuzzy logic sys- tem (IT2FLS) for the problem of nodule classification in a lung computer-aided detection system. The designed IT2FLS is com- pared with its type-1 fuzzy logic system (T1FLS) counterpart. The results demonstrate that the IT2FLS outperforms the T1FLS by more than 30\% in terms of classification accuracy},

At present, there are a number of smart home applications being developed with a raft of technologies that provide fragments of the necessary functionality. Nevertheless, there is currently a major gap between these endeavours and the vision of smart homes in which there are adaptive, personalised and context-aware assistance capabilities. To bridge this divide between practice and aspiration, this paper introduces semantic smart homes – a novel conception whose aim is to move from the current state of the art of smart home technologies to the future infrastructure that is needed to support the full richness of the smart home vision. We present a conceptual system architecture for semantic smart homes and elaborate functions and explore the interplay of constituent components. The paper focuses predominantly on the methodology of semantic modeling, content generation and management. We illustrate the potential of the semantic smart homes metaphor through a number of use scenarios.},

abstract = {While most activity recognition systems rely on data-driven approaches, the use of knowledge-driven tech- niques is gaining increasing interest. Research in this field has mainly concentrated on the use of ontologies to specify the semantics of activities, and ontological reasoning to recognize them based on context information. However, at the time of writing, the experimental evaluation of these techniques is limited to computational aspects; their actual effectiveness is still unknown. As a first step to fill this gap, in this paper, we experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of the ontological approach, using an activity dataset collected in a smart-home setting. Preliminary results suggest that existing ontological techniques underperform data-driven ones, mainly because they lack support for reasoning with temporal infor- mation. Indeed, we show that, when ontological techniques are extended with even simple forms of temporal reasoning, their effectiveness is comparable to the one of a state-of- the-art technique based on Hidden Markov Models. Then, we indicate possible research directions to further improve the effectiveness of ontology-based activity recognition through temporal reasoning.},

This paper provides an interesting comparison of ontology-based VS data-driven activity recognition. They point out the importance of temporal reasoning for acitivity recognition, which data-driven approaches handle, but not the ontological ones. They propose some wats to handle temporal reasoning in the ontological approach and show the results may outperform data-driven approaches. Finally, they show future lines for incorporating complex temporal reasoning in ontologic frameworks

The knowledge of human behaviour pattern enables the ambient environment to communicate with the user in a seamless way and make anticipatory decisions, from the automation of ap- pliances and personal schedule reminder to the detection of unhealthy habits. Our learning method is general and learns from a set of activity sequences, where the granularity of activities can vary for different applications. Algorithms to extract the activity information from the videos are described. We evaluate our method on video sequences captured in a real office, where the user’s daily routine is recorded over a month. The results show that our approach is capable of not only identifying the frequent behaviour of the user, but also the time relations and conditions of the activities.},

abstract = {The past decade has witnessed a rapid proliferation of video cameras in all walks of life and has resulted in a tremen- dous explosion of video content. Several applications such as con- tent-based video annotation and retrieval, highlight extraction and video summarization require recognition of the activities occur- ring in the video. The analysis of human activities in videos is an area with increasingly important consequences from security and surveillance to entertainment and personal archiving. Several chal- lenges at various levels of processing—robustness against errors in low-level processing, view and rate-invariant representations at midlevel processing and semantic representation of human activi- ties at higher level processing—make this problem hard to solve. In this review paper, we present a comprehensive survey of efforts in the past couple of decades to address the problems of representa- tion, recognition, and learning of human activities from video and related applications. We discuss the problem at two major levels of complexity: 1) “actions” and 2) “activities.” “Actions” are char- acterized by simple motion patterns typically executed by a single human. “Activities” are more complex and involve coordinated ac- tions among a small number of humans. We will discuss several approaches and classify them according to their ability to handle varying degrees of complexity as interpreted above.We begin with a discussion of approaches to model the simplest of action classes known as atomic or primitive actions that do not require sophis- ticated dynamical modeling. Then, methods to model actions with more complex dynamics are discussed. The discussion then leads naturally to methods for higher level representation of complex activities.},

@techreport{Teflioudi2011,
abstract = {Recent progress in information extraction has enabled us to create large semantic knowledge bases with millions of RDF facts extracted from the Web. Nevertheless, the resulting knowledge bases are still incomplete or might contain inconsistencies, either because of the heuristic nature of the extraction process, or due to the varying reliability of the Web sources from which they were collected. One possible way of resolving both issues is to reinforce the knowledge base with deductive power by appending first-order logical inference rules, which help to describe and to further constrain the domain with which the ontology deals. In our work, we investigate learning these rules directly from the data using Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), a well known technique, which lies in the intersection of machine learning and logic. Although powerful, ILP is inherently expensive as there is a combinatorial growth of the search space when constructing these rules, as the size of the background knowledge grows. In addition, the evaluation of each rule becomes more expensive, as the number of the training examples is rising. Apart from that, it is not always obvious how to automatically select positive and negative training examples needed for learning new rules over an incomplete knowledge base. This Master thesis explores the issues involved when applying ILP in an incomplete and large RDF-knowledge base.},

@article{Wolter2012,
abstract = {About two decades ago the field of qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning (QSTR) has emerged as a new area of AI research that set out to grasp human-level understanding and reasoning about spatial and temporal entities, linking formal approaches to cognitive theories. Em- powering artificial agents with QSTR capabilities is claimed to facilitate manifold applications, including robot navigation, geographic informa- tion systems (GIS), natural language understanding and computer-aided design. QSTR is an active field of research that has developed many rep- resentation and reasoning approaches so far, but only comparatively few applications exist that actually build on these QSTR techniques. In this article we approach QSTR from an application perspective. Considering the exemplary application domains of robot navigation, GIS, and computer-aided design, we conclude that reasoning must be inter- preted in a broader sense than the often-considered constraint-based rea- soning and that supporting tools must become available. We discuss the newly identified reasoning tasks and how they can be supported by QSTR toolboxes to foster the dissemination of QSTR in applications. Fur- thermore, we explain how we aim to overcome the lack-of-tools dilemma through the development of our QSTR toolbox SparQ.},

Consid- ering the wide variety of settings in which surveillance systems are being deployed, it is necessary to create a common knowledge-base or ontology of human activities. Most current attempts at ontology design in computer vision for human activities have been empiri- cal in nature. In this paper, we present a more systematic approach to address the problem of designing ontologies for visual activity recognition. We draw on general ontology design principles and adapt them to the specific domain of human activity ontologies. Then, we discuss qualitative evaluation principles and provide sev- eral examples from existing ontologies and how they can be im- proved upon. Finally, we demonstrate quantitatively in terms of recognition performance, the efficacy and validity of our approach for bank and airport tarmac surveillance domains.},

We demonstrate the success of this model by applying it to the problem domain of Raven’s Progressive Matrices, a widely used tool in the field of intelligence testing. The model is able to generate the rules necessary to correctly solve Raven’s items, as well as recreate many of the experimental effects observed in human subjects},

@article{Jeong2012,
abstract = {In this paper, we present results and experiments with several methods for bundle adjustment, producing the fastest bundle adjuster ever published in terms of computation and convergence. From a computational perspective, the fastest methods naturally handle the block-sparse pattern that arises in a reduced camera system. Adapting to the naturally arising block-sparsity allows the use of BLAS3, efficient memory handling, fast variable ordering, and customized sparse solving, all simultaneously. We present two methods; one uses exact minimum degree ordering and block-based LDL solving and the other uses block-based preconditioned conjugate gradients. Both methods are performed on the reduced camera system. We show experimentally that the adaptation to the natural block sparsity allows both of these methods to perform better than previous methods. Further improvements in convergence speed are achieved by the novel use of embedded point iterations. Embedded point iterations take place inside each camera update step, yielding a greater cost decrease from each camera update step and, consequently, a lower minimum. This is especially true for points projecting far out on the flatter region of the robustifier. Intensive analyses from various angles demonstrate the improved performance of the presented bundler.},

This paper presents a case-based reasoning approach to activity recognition in a smart home setting. An analysis is performed on scalability with respect to case storage, and an ontology-based approach is proposed for case base maintenance.

abstract = {The machine learning and pervasive sensing technologies found in smart homes offer unprecedented opportunities for providing health monitoring and assistance to individuals experiencing difficulties living independently at home. In order to monitor the functional health of smart home residents, we need to design technologies that recognize and track activities that people normally perform as part of their daily routines. Although approaches do exist for recognizing activities, the approaches are applied to activities that have been pre-selected and for which labeled training data is available. In contrast, we introduce an automated approach to activity tracking that identifies frequent activities that naturally occur in an individual’s routine. With this capability we can then track the occurrence of regular activities to monitor functional health and to detect changes in an individual’s patterns and lifestyle. In this paper we describe our activity mining and tracking approach and validate our algorithms on data collected in physical smart environments.},
annote = {        Summary:
                
A very interesting paper where authors propose data-driven approaches for activity recognition without any labeled data-base. Broadly speaking, they take sensor data-bases and search for patterns (even interleaved patterns). They apply a novel algorithm called DVSM for that. Afterwards, they apply a clustering algorithm (K-Means where similiarity measure is defined by them), to goup all patterns that are similar. Hence, each cluster represents a unique activity and contains different ways that activity has been executed by the user in the data-base. Afterwards, they use the clusters to train a boosted HMM in order to be able to recognize new activities.
        
The approach is very interesting, but it differs a lot from ours: activities are recognized, but they do not have any semantic meaning, so they are not understandable for humans. The systems is not extensible to other users or environments (or at least, hardly extensible) and it suffers the "cold start" problem.
        
DVSM algorithm:
- It can detect discontinuous patterns
- It is an unsupervised learning approach
- They talk about the Gais approach [35], which is a supervised approach with genetic algorithms and known pattern templates. This can be our case, since patterns are modeled in seed activity models
- Sequence mining and clustering address a portion of their problem. They combine both in their Activity Discovery Method
- Specifically: for frequent sequence mining, they develop the DVSM algorithm
- Algorithm steps:
* Reduce input data creating another dataset containing the top alpha most frequent events
* Slide a window of size 2 across reduced dataset to find patterns of length 2
* I do not understand the next step: extend the patterns discovered in the previous step by their prefix and suffix events and match the extended pattern against the already-discovered patterns to see if it's a variation of a previous pattern or if it's a new pattern
* The similarity between patterns A and B is based on the Levenshtein distance or edit distance
* At the end of each iteration, infrequent variations of a general patter and infrequent general patterns are pruned
* Interesting general patterns are detected if they satisfy inequality (2)
* Interesting variations of a general pattern are detected if they satisfy inequality (3)
* They introduce the notion of continuity of a pattern. If a general pattern A=\{a, b, c\} is instantiated in a dataset as \{a, b, g, j, k, c\}, the continuity of the pattern is not high
* They use the continuity definition to update the inequalities to consider interesting general patterns and variations
* All those general patterns and variations that do not satisfy the inequality, are pruned
* The algorithm follows extendening the pattern by their suffix and prefix events until no more interesting patterns are found},

Many of these use non-linear models to handle complex data-relationships in the input data. Their lack of transparency, however, is problematic since compre- hensibility is a key requirement in many potential application domains. Rule-extraction algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem for classification by extracting comprehensi- ble rulesets from the often better performing, complex models. We present a new pedagogical rule extraction algorithm for regression, based on active learning, which can be combined with any existing rule induction technique. Empirical results show that the proposed ALPA-R rule extraction method im- proves on classical rule induction techniques, both in accuracy and fidelit},

abstract = {Activity models play a critical role for activity recognition and assistance in ambient assisted living. Existing approaches to activity modeling suffer from a number of problems, e.g. cold-start, model reusability and incompleteness. In an effort to address these problems, we introduce an ontology- based hybrid approach to activity modeling that combines domain knowledge based model specification and data-driven model learning. Central to the approach is an iterative process that begins with “seed” activity models created by ontological engineering. The “seed” models are deployed, and subsequently evolved through incremental activity discovery and model update. While our previous work has detailed ontological activity modeling and activity recognition, this paper focuses on the systematic hybrid approach and associated methods and inference rules for learning new activities and user activity profiles. The approach has been implemented in a feature-rich assistive living system. Analysis of the experiments conducted has been undertaken in an effort to test and evaluate the activity learning algorithms and associated mechanisms.},
annote = {        Summary:
                
Authors present a hybrid model that combines data-driven approaches and ontological based activity models. They argue that knowledge-driven activity models are static and lack of the specific ways a person executes activities. To tackle the problem, they propose a three step iterative process.
        
1) Create the ontological-based activity recognition system manually, where seed activity models are developed
        
2) Collect sensor data (action traces) and classify them using the recognition system -> generate 2 groups: recognised activities (LATs) and unrecognised activities (UATs)
        
3) Learn user profiles with LATs and new activity models with UATs
        
User profiles have three main fields: objetc pattern, duration and activity pattern. They propose some techniques based on semantic similarity measures and frequency analysis to learn those three aspects of an activity model.
        
Additionally, authors also show a method to learn new activities from UATs. Using a semantic similarity measure they cluster UATs. Each cluster represents a new activity that has to be labeled and manually introduced to the ontologic activity models.
                  
Terms and notation
        Activity = ontological concept
Activity is defined by action properties (hasTeabag, hasFlavour...)
Activities also have descriptive properties (actId, actStartTime, actDuration...)
Action properties play a crucial role in activity recognition
Descriptive properties, on the other hand, are not determinants in activity recognition
Action trace = sequence of sensor observations within a time segment},

abstract = {Dynamic uncertainties, manifested as input noise or variable environment conditions, are an inherent part of most real world control applications. Recently, several researchers demonstrated that Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controllers (T2 FLC) are able to cope with such uncertainty and reduce its negative effects. However, the design and optimization of T2 FLC and its subsequent unbiased comparison to T1 FLC are still an open question. This paper presents a comparative analysis of interval T2 (IT2) and T1 FLCs in the context of learning behaviors for mobile robotics. First, a T1 FLC is optimized using the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to mimic a wall-following behavior performed by an operator. Next, an IT2 FLC is constructed by symmetrically blurring the fuzzy sets of the original T1 FLC. The performance of the fuzzy controllers is compared using a wall-following sonar-equipped mobile robot in both noise-free and noisy environments. It is experimentally demonstrated that the IT2 FLC can cope better with dynamic uncertainties in the sensory inputs due to the softening and smoothing of the output control surface by the IT2 fuzzy sets. However, the IT2 FLC is outperformed by the T1 FLC when sudden and fast response of the controller is required, such as in the case of turning around corners. Those results suggest the difficulties of symmetrical blurring of T1 FLC (although commonly used) as a design methodology for obtaining the architecture of an IT2 FLC.},

abstract = {Representing dynamic information in the form of ontologies, as well as querying and reasoning over static and dynamic ontologies are the areas of interest in this work. Building upon well established standards of the semantic Web and the 4D-fluents approach for representing the evolution of temporal information in ontologies, SOWL illustrates how spatial and spatio-temporal information and evolution in space and time can be efficiently represented in OWL. It also demonstrates how qualitative temporal and spatial relations that are common in natural language expressions (i.e., rela- tions between time intervals like “before”, “after”, etc.) are represented in the ontology. Existing approaches allow for representations of only static, spatial or temporal informa- tion, but do not support combinations on the nature of in- formation or representation of qualitative relations. Part of the proposed representation model is the SOWL (high-level) query language, which does not require users to be familiar with peculiarities of the underlying ontology representation (which can be complex) and handles ontologies similar to relational databases. A distinct feature of SOWL is the in- corporation spatio-temporal reasoning in SOWL, which is capable of inferring spatio-temporal information from rep- resentations in the underlying ontology model. 1.},

abstract = {Fuzzy systems have demonstrated their ability to solve different kinds of problems in various application domains. Currently, there is an increasing interest to augment fuzzy systems with learning and adapta- tion capabilities. Two of the most successful approaches to hybridise fuzzy systems with learning and adapta- tion methods have been made in the realm of soft computing. Neural fuzzy systems and genetic fuzzy systems hybridise the approximate reasoning method of fuzzy systems with the learning capabilities of neural networks and evolutionary algorithms. The objective of this paper is to provide an account of genetic fuzzy systems, with special attention to genetic fuzzy rule-based systems. After a brief introduction to models and applications of genetic fuzzy systems, the ?eld is overviewed, new trends are identi?ed, a critical evaluation of genetic fuzzy systems for fuzzy knowledge extraction is elaborated, and open questions that remain to be addressed in the future are raised. The paper also includes some of the key references required to quickly access implementation details of genetic fuzzy systems.},

abstract = {Human activity recognition is a challenging problem for context-aware systems and applications. Research in this field hasmainly adopted techniques based on supervised learning algorithms, but these systemssuffer from scalability issues with respect to the number of considered activities and contextual data. In this paper, we propose a solution based on the use of ontologies and ontological rea- soning combined with statistical inferencing. Structured symbolic knowledge about the environment surrounding the user allows the recognition system to infer which activities among the candidates identified by statistical methods are more likely to be the actual activity that the user is per- forming. Ontological reasoning is also integrated with sta- tistical methods to recognize complex activities that cannot be derived by statistical methods alone. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is supported by experiments with a complete implementation of the system using commercially available sensors and an Android-based handheld device as the host for the main activity recognition module.},
annote = {Summary:
        
Authors present an approach to combine data-driven approaches with ontological reasoning for activity recognition. However, the approach is quite simple. They use data-driven approaches to train models that use sensor data (mainly IMUs) for activity recognition. On the other hand, they use an ontology to describe the activities and mainly their relationships with locations. 
        
They present an algorithm (DPA) that using the definitions of activities and locations, infers which activities can be executed in which locations, usign consistency checks of the ontology. Using the result, they evaluate the ouptut of the data-drien system in the following way:
        
1) Take the most probable activity
2) Check whether the activity can be performed in the location reported by the localization system
3) If Yes, the actiity has been recognised
4) If Not, discard the prediction and go back to step 1
        
As future work they identify the extension of the ontology to include also temporal information (duration, sequence of activities...).},

Automated knowledge acquisition of that kind has been an essential aspect of artificial intelligence since a long time and has more recently also attracted considerable attention in the fuzzy sets community. This pa- per briefly reviews some typical applications and highlights potential contributions that fuzzy set theory can make to machine learning, data mining, and related fields. In this connection, some advantages of fuzzy methods for representing and mining vague patterns in data are especially emphasized.},

abstract = {Recent interest in probabilistic logic as a formalism for ma- chine learning has motivated the formulation of “probabilistic rule learn- ing”, where the task is to induce a set of logical rules from a probabilis- tic database. We start by defining rule learning within propositional, probabilistic logic. Then we show that this problem can be viewed as a regression task with integer variables. This problem is translated into Mixed Linear Programming, which is experimentally shown to provide a speedup over the current implementation. The advantage of this ap- proach is the ability to switch between logically interpretable rule learn- ing with binary coefficients and classical regression with rational coeffi- cients.},

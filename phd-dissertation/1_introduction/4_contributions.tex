%The following major and minor contributions can be found in this dissertation:
The following scientific contributions can be found in this dissertation:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A two-step activity clustering algorithm which uses generic but incomplete activity models and context knowledge to recognise action clusters that form an activity and aggregate new actions. The activity clustering algorithm idea is introduced in Chapter \ref{cha:archi} and it is explained thorough Chapter \ref{cha:clustering}.
  \item A learning algorithm that uses activity clusters to learn personalised activity models for every defined activity. This learning algorithm is first presented in Chapter \ref{cha:archi} and further developed in Chapter \ref{cha:learner}.
  \item A hybrid evaluation methodology for activity modelling and recognition, based on surveys to users and simulation tools. This evaluation methodology is fully described and applied in Chapter \ref{cha:evaluation}. The details of the methodology can be found in Section \ref{subsec:evaluation:hybrid}.
\end{itemize}

In order to deliver those scientific contributions, a technical contribution has also be posed in this dissertation:

\begin{itemize}
 \item A synthetic dataset generator tool: a special simulation tool for sensor dataset generation designed and developed to apply the hybrid evaluation methodology to the activity modelling approach. The software tool is described in Chapter \ref{cha:evaluation}, concretely in Section \ref{subsubsec:evaluation:synthetic}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Identifying Relevant Information}
\label{sec:learner:relevant}

Explain all the available information: actions, objects, patterns, frequencies, duration.

Explain why pattern similarity and associated frequencies are the best candidates to learn EAMs. Duration is discarded because of the InRange function and because no clear relationship between duration and spurious activities have been found. 

Explain the approach to identify spurious action sequences (due to sensor noise and clustering errors).

Explain the problems arose from using frequency as criterion.

Conclude with the fact that only similarity of action sequences can be used in order to keep all variations performed by a user.

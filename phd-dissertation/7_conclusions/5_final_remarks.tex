\section{Final Remarks}
\label{sec:conclusions:final}

With this dissertation we have tried to make significant contributions in the area of activity modelling and recognition, which is deemed to play an important role in human-centred intelligent systems. We hope that the presented contributions and identified future research lines will serve to other researchers as a guide to deliver further contributions and thus keep advancing in such an important research area.

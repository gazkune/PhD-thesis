\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions:future}

Write about future work:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Research on sensor-action mapping steps to distinguish between meaningful and meaningless user-object interactions, in order to avoid object interactions due to user erratic behaviour.
 \item Extend the approach to single-user concurrent activities scenario.
 \item Research on perception approaches to model complex actions: rather than \textit{hasBottle} action, be able to map to \textit{opensBottle}, \textit{poursBottleContent}, \textit{closesBottle} and so on. It seems vision-based perception is the best option for this perception level. A good approach could be to use Google Glass, because they provide a convenient and comfortable way to monitor what objects and how a user is using.
 \item Research on sensor uncertainty: complex perception approaches will generate uncertain action mappings. This uncertainty has to be handled in the learning and modelling stage.
 \item Research on temporal dependency relations between actions: activity models should provide richer information about what actions depend on other actions. For example, introduce fish in the oven after the oven has been switched on. Some actions can be performed in any order, but some of them have temporal dependencies.
\end{itemize}

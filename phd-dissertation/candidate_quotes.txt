The Approach to Learn Specialised and Complete Activity Models

Good design is a Renaissance attitude that combines technology, cognitive science, human need and beauty to produce something.
Paola Antonelli (2001), curator of architecture and design, Museum of Modern Art, New York

Simplicity is the keynote of all true elegance.
Coco Chanel

* Simplicity is the shortest path to a solution.
Ward Cunningham

Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.
Albert Einstein

Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
More learned than the ears.
William Shakespeare

What's done can't be undone.
William Shakespeare

* If you keep doing what you've always done, you'll keep getting what you've always gotten.
Neil Strauss

So many worlds, so much to do,
So little done, such things to be.
Alfred Tennyson

We cannot think first and act afterwards. From the moment of birth we are immersed in action and can only fitfully guide it by taking thought.
Alfred North Whitehead

The shortest answer is doing.
George Herbert

* The beautiful thing about learning is that nobody can take it away from you
B.B. King

We learn from failure, not from success!
Bram Stoker

Learning is not child's play; we cannot learn without pain.

Evaluation
------------------------------------

The game of science is, in principle, without end. He who decides one day that scientific statements do not call for any further test, and that they can be regarded as finally verified, retires from the game.
Karl Popper

I don't claim to be a methodologist, but I act like one only because I do methodology to protect myself from crazy methodologists.
Ward Cunningham

It is those who know little, and not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science.
Charles Darwin

* Science is a way of trying not to fool yourself. The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.
Richard Feynman

Science, at bottom, is really anti-intellectual. It always distrusts pure reason, and demands the production of objective fact.
H.L. Mencken

We are trying to prove ourselves wrong as quickly as possible, because only in that way can we find progress. 
Richard Feynman

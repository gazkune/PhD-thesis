\letra{T}{his} chapter describes the general architecture of the solution designed to learn activity models from user's behavioural data and previous knowledge. Provide here also the basis of ontology-based activity modelling to provide a solid base for our approach. Show the intuition that led us to the final solution (the plot with actions in three axis: time, location and type). Provide the design architecture, implementation details and finally the definitions and constraints related to the solution.

Here, show how the chapter is structured in sections:
